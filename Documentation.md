* /wirez threadinfo (provides a paste with a key with full details of what threads are in use for the platform WireZ is running on)
* /wirez threaddump (provides a paste with a key with thread dump stacktraces. becareful when using this as this could result in your platform freezing due to syncs locking)

* /wirez listtables <database> (provides a paste with a key of what tables a database is made up of)
