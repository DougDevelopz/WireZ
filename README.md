* **CPU Profiler** View performance aspects of a platform.
* **Memory Summarizer** View memory aspects of a platform.
* **Thread Information** View the use of threads of a platform.
* **Health Format Graphs** View the health of a certain system component.

### :electric_plug: CPU Profiler:

WireZ CPU profiler is used to collect the use of system performance.

*Benefits:

* **Lightweight** Will have zero impact on your platform's performance
